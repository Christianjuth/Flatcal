                <h1>Privacy Practices</h1>
                <p>I am a strong believer in privacy and protecting anonymity online. Data is only collected with the intension of improving FlatCal. Additionally, I have done my best to remove any information that could be considered personal identifiable. I do not collect names, emails, or exact location's of any users! I do not even have access to that information. I have attempted to scramble IP addresses, and I assure you I will continue to do my best to protect the anonymity of FlatCal users. FlatCal is opensource, and you can see all the sourcecode <a href="https://github.com/christianjuth/flatcal">here</a>. FlatCal's sourcecode falls under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">The MIT license</a>.</p>

                <p>Examples of Data We Collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User ID</strong> - Randomly generated to assosiate crashes with users (ex. 65460cdc-0a83-d9fa-e7b3-2974a79c3d39).</li>
                    <li><strong>Pages Visited.</strong> We track which pages in FlatCal are used to improve the product.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crash Reports.</strong> Software isn't perfect. We log error info when we mess up to help debug FlatCal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Features Used.</strong> We track which FlatCal features are popular in order to improve the product.</li>
                    <li><strong>Browser Version.</strong> This helps us see which browsers we need to test FlatCal on the most.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operating System.</strong> FlatCal adapts to meet OS needs. This info helps debug crashes and improve the product.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Services We Use:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google Analytics</strong> - analytics</li>
                    <li><strong>Sentury.io</strong> - crash reporting</li>
                </ul>

                <p>User ID is used in place of IP addresses because it is both more anonomous and more consistent. Analytics and crash reports help me diagnose issues with FlatCal and figure out which features are worth focusing on. There is currently no way to opt out of this anonymous data collection. FlatCal is a side project, it is free to use, and this data helps me deliever the best expierence possible to users. I hope you understand, and thank you for using FlatCal.</p>
