# FlatCal - The best calculator for Google Chrome

FlatCal designed to be modular! Please feel free to repurpose code for your your own project. The actual equation engine solving engine lives in `src/assets/js/Equation.js` and it depends on both [Algebrite](http://algebrite.org/) and [math.js](http://mathjs.org/).
