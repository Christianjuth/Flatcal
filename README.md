# FlatCal - a minimalistic calculator Chrome Extension

FlatCal is the second Chrome Extension I launched on the Chrome Webstore and the first big step I took in developing my web design skills. FlatCal took the simplest idea, a calculator, and made it the most customizable thing ever. FlatCal comes with eight built-in themes and the option to design your own. The purpose of FlatCal was to create a simple, elegant calculator you can use from your browser. 

### Why I built FlatCal
I found myself writing papers on Google Drive and doing research on Google. Because of this, I decided having a calculator at my fingertips all the time would be useful. After a quick search on the Chrome Webstore, there was nothing that worked well and looked half decent. I had found my calling. I undertook the responsibility of creating a calculator that is elegant in design, customizable, and works. Here are a few things FlatCal users have said.
